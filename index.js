"Whoops! I just invented the tossed salad!"
"No more clowning around, Koopa! You're Koo-put!"
"[Bowser is] having a coffin spell!"
"A Mario Brother never says 'can't', Luigi!"
"I never saw so many tonsils in all my life!"
"Brave men die a single death; cowards marry fish-head mermaids!"
"Uh, excuse my brother, he gets nervous around guys six times bigger than him!"
"My brother's been turned into an egg, and now these wretched reptiles want us to play football with my brother as the ball! I mean, what's the kingdom comin' to?!"
"We can fix anything if there's spaghetti involved!"
"Life is a game, kid! It all depends on how you play!"
"Tea hee... I mean, tee hee!"
"Oops. I meant to do that."
"I wish Luigi were here, I could blame him!"
"Oh, no! The Princess is being forced to listen to a debate by two Fry guys about the names of the little things on the end of your shoelaces!"
"Stay away, you guys. I overslept, and I have to save the Princess!"
"When the going gets tough, the tough read Dirk Drain-Head!"
"Get your grimy meat hooks off of my mag, Luigi!"
"Why do salesmen always have such bouncy personalities?"
"But I've got drains to drain! Clogs to unclog! Remember... the noble always comes through? Besides, this coat is turning my hair brown!"
"Sticky juice! The stickier the sauce, the better I like it!"
"Oh no! It's a pipe-o-Rama!"
"Okay, I think we're finally out of danger, Luigi. Luigi...?! That louse! He's probably cowering in some little hideaway at this very moment! And he didn't even tell me about it!!"
"No woman can resist the charm of a Mario."
"You better get a lawyer or get us out of this chicken coop!"
"What my brother is trying to say, is he doesn't know what to say."
